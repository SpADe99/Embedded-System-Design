# Week 10 Examples (Interfacing with Motors)

## Example 1

Use Blinky class to flash LED ON and OFF for 1s.

## Example 2

Use Blinky class to generate PWM signal at PB5 with 200µs on and 300µs off time.

## Example 3

Use Blinky class to generate PWM signal at PB5 with 100µs on and 200µs off time.

## Example 4

Use the DCMotor class to generate a 50Hz PWM waveform at PB0 with 50% duty cycle.

## Example 5

Use the DCMotor class to generate a 1kHz PWM waveform at PB0 with 20% duty cycle.

## Example 6

Drive 4 DC Motors connected to PB0, PB1, PB2 and PB3 with 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% duty cycles at 500Hz.

## Example 7

Drive 4 DC Motors connected to PB0, PB1, PB2 and PB3 with 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% duty cycles at 1kHz.

## Example 8

Use PID class and a sensor to continuously adjust the speed of a DC motor as part of a control system. 

## Example 9

4 servo motors are attached to PB0, PB1, PB2 and PB3. Use Servo class to make these servos turn 90° with pulse width of 1.5ms.

## Example 10

A signal pin of a servo motor is attached to PB0. Write a program to make the servo rotate back and forth (sweeping) with the following parameters: Minimum pulse width = 544us, Maximum pulse width = 2400us, Step size = 10us, Delay = 25ms.

## Example 11

4 servo motors are connected to PB0 to PB3. Using Servo and ServoSweeperclasses, write a program to make the 4 servo sweep.

## Example 12

Rotate the stepper motor  in clockwise direction at a rate of 200 steps/s in wave drive mode.

## Example 13

Rotate the stepper motor  in counter-clockwise direction at a rate of 500 steps/s in wave drive mode.

## Example 14

Rotate the stepper motor  in clockwise direction at a rate of 500 steps/s in full drive mode.

## Example 15

Rotate the stepper motor  in counter-clockwise direction at a rate of 250 steps/s in half-step drive mode.

## Example 16

Two unipolar stepper motors are connected to PORTB (0 to 3) and PORTD (0 to 3). Motor 1: clockwise, 500 steps/s, full-step drive mode. Motor 2: counter-clockwise, 500 steps/s, half-step drive mode.
